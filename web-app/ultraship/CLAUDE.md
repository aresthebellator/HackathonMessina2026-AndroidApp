# Ultraship — Claude Code Plugin

All-in-one builder plugin for Claude Code. npm: `ultraship`, GitHub: `Houseofmvps/ultraship`.

## Project Structure

```
.claude-plugin/   — Plugin manifest (plugin.json)
skills/           — 45 skills (workflow + specialist + growth/launch/intelligence; includes staying-current, a11y, ship-gate, evals)
agents/           — 13 agents (review, seo, seo-strategist, security, pentest, perf, a11y, browser, compete, launch, incident, growth, canary)
commands/         — 16 command files (/ship, /seo, /secure, /review, /perf, /profile, /bundle, /deps, /health, /redirects, /codex, /content, etc.). NOTE: every skill is ALSO a slash command, so /a11y, /sprint, /pentest, /compete, /canary, /launch, /rescue, /grow etc. all work — the 21 redundant command launchers that duplicated same-named skills were removed 2026-06-28 (Anthropic merged commands into skills).
tools/            — 41 Node.js tools (ga4-client, keyword-intelligence, index-doctor, seo-scanner, a11y-scanner, ship-gate, vibe-security-scanner, eval-scanner, lighthouse, pentest-scanner, codex-generator, etc.) + shared lib/ship-scoring.mjs (single source of truth for /ship + ship-gate scoring)
hooks/            — SessionStart + UserPromptSubmit (Currency Guard) + PostCompact hooks + guard hooks (PreToolUse for destructive command blocking)
docs/             — Documentation
```

## Tech Stack

- Node.js ESM (type: module)
- Zero external dependencies — HTML parsing via `tools/lib/html-parser.mjs` (inline SAX-style parser)
- No build step — tools run directly via `node tools/<tool>.mjs`
- All tools use `execFileSync` (not `execSync`) to prevent shell injection

## Key Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `seo-scanner.mjs` | SEO scanner (39 rules) + GEO signals (20 rules: AI bot access, snippet restrictions, structured data) + AEO signals (4 rules: schema checks). Cross-page analysis, analytics detection, canonical conflicts. |
| `a11y-scanner.mjs` | Static accessibility scanner (WCAG 2.2 A/AA subset): missing alt, unlabeled form controls, empty buttons/links, missing `lang`/`title`/`main`, heading order, positive tabindex, zoom disabled, duplicate ids, broken aria references. Zero false positives. Dispatched by `/ship`; rendered contrast/focus checks escalate to `npx pa11y` via the `/a11y` skill. |
| `ship-gate.mjs` | Blocking quality gate. Subcommands: `init` (write `.ultraship/ship-gate.json` thresholds), `run` (score via shared `lib/ship-scoring.mjs`, compare to thresholds, hard-fail on leaked secrets / critical findings, **exit 1 on fail**), `ci` (write `.github/workflows/ship-gate.yml`), `hook` (write `.git/hooks/pre-push`). Same scoring as `/ship` so they never disagree. |
| `content-scorer.mjs` | Readability (Flesch-Kincaid), keyword density, GEO heading analysis |
| `og-validator.mjs` | Open Graph tag validation, image reachability check |
| `redirect-checker.mjs` | Redirect chain/loop detection, mixed protocol, sitemap-based bulk check |
| `lighthouse-runner.mjs` | Lighthouse via headless Chrome, extracts CWV + diagnostics |
| `health-check.mjs` | Production health check (status, response time, SSL, security headers) |
| `env-validator.mjs` | Validates required env vars from .env.example against actual .env |
| `migration-checker.mjs` | Detects pending DB migrations (Drizzle, Prisma, Knex) |
| `bundle-tracker.mjs` | Bundle size tracking with history, heavy dependency detection |
| `audit-history.mjs` | Saves/compares audit scores over time |
| `api-smoke-test.mjs` | API endpoint smoke testing (status codes, response times, CORS) |
| `gsc-client.mjs` | Google Search Console API (JWT auth via service account) |
| `bing-webmaster.mjs` | Bing Webmaster API — 11 commands: submit-sitemap, list-sitemaps, submit-url, submit-url-batch, url-info, query, indexnow, keyword-research, backlinks, site-scan, url-inspection |
| `code-profiler.mjs` | Static analysis for N+1 queries, sync I/O, memory leaks, unbounded queries |
| `dep-doctor.mjs` | Detects unused/outdated dependencies, recommends removals |
| `secret-scanner.mjs` | Detects leaked secrets, skips .env.example files |
| `vibe-security-scanner.mjs` | Vibe-Coding Security Sentinel — context-aware checks secret-scanner misses: server-only secrets behind a public env prefix (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`/`VITE_`/etc.), a decoded Supabase `service_role` JWT exposed to the client, service_role referenced in a `"use client"` file, Supabase tables created without RLS (gated on a Supabase signal), and an advisory for mutation routes with no auth lib. Zero false positives. |
| `eval-scanner.mjs` | Locates every LLM call site (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Cohere, Ollama, Vercel AI SDK, LangChain) by provider + model id via real import/require detection (no local `./ai` false positives), detects the test runner and whether a Promptfoo/eval suite already exists, and flags AI features shipping with no evals. Seeds the `/evals` skill. Zero false positives. |
| `sitemap-generator.mjs` | Generates sitemap.xml from HTML files |
| `robots-generator.mjs` | Generates AI-friendly robots.txt (allows GPTBot, PerplexityBot, etc.) |
| `structured-data-generator.mjs` | Generates JSON-LD structured data |
| `llms-txt-generator.mjs` | Generates llms.txt for AI discoverability |
| `compete-analyzer.mjs` | Competitive X-Ray — compares two sites on tech stack, SEO, perf, security |
| `launch-prep.mjs` | Launch Day Autopilot — generates launch copy, checklist, press kit |
| `incident-commander.mjs` | Production Incident Commander — diagnoses outages, suggests rollback |
| `growth-tracker.mjs` | Post-Ship Growth Intelligence — tracks metrics over time |
| `cost-tracker.mjs` | AI Build Cost Tracker — tracks spend per feature/model |
| `onboard-generator.mjs` | Instant Project Onboarding — generates developer onboarding guide |
| `architecture-mapper.mjs` | Living Architecture Map — auto-generates Mermaid diagrams |
| `pattern-analyzer.mjs` | Learn From the Best — analyzes and compares codebase patterns |
| `demo-prep.mjs` | Demo-Ready Mode — finds dev artifacts, generates walkthrough |
| `pentest-scanner.mjs` | Penetration testing — XSS, SQLi, SSTI, CORS, JWT, GraphQL, prototype pollution, race conditions. Zero false positives. |
| `canary-monitor.mjs` | Post-deploy canary monitoring — HTTP status, response time, error patterns, baseline regression detection |
| `retro-analyzer.mjs` | Sprint retrospective — git velocity, commit patterns, test health, hot files, shipping cadence |
| `learnings-manager.mjs` | Project learnings CRUD — save, search, list, prune, export structured knowledge |
| `ga4-client.mjs` | Google Analytics 4 Data API — 12 commands: overview, top-pages, traffic-sources, conversions, landing-pages, user-journey, search-terms, geo, devices, realtime, ai-traffic (ChatGPT/Perplexity/Copilot), organic. --organic flag for search-only filtering. Key event rates per page. |
| `keyword-intelligence.mjs` | Keyword analysis — 12 commands: analyze (with difficulty + topical authority + SERP features + position bands), quick-wins, cannibalization, content-gaps, intent-map, trending, high-intent, page-keywords, content-decay, difficulty, anomalies (low-position high-CTR), cross-reference (GSC↔GA4). Brand filtering via --brand flag. |
| `index-doctor.mjs` | Index diagnosis — inspects URLs via GSC, diagnoses non-indexing reasons (nosnippet/max-snippet detection), auto-submits fixes to Bing |
| `codex-generator.mjs` | Codebase index — compact map of routes, schema, components, lib exports, structure. Stack-agnostic (JS/TS, Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, Rust, Java). Writes `.ultraship/codex.md` to save AI tokens. Skips audit fields + shadcn/radix UI primitives. Route paths validated (no false positives from non-route code). |

## Security

- All HTTP-making tools import `tools/lib/security.mjs` for SSRF protection, response size limits
- `validateUrl()` blocks private IPs, cloud metadata, non-HTTP schemes
- `checkFileSize()` prevents OOM by capping reads at 10MB
- `createResponseAccumulator()` caps HTTP responses at 5MB
- File writes use mode `0o600`, directories `0o700`
- Secret scanner redacts found values in output
- Lighthouse version is pinned (`lighthouse@12`) to prevent supply chain attacks

## Conventions

- Tools output JSON to stdout, errors exit with code 0 (never crash Claude Code)
- Skills use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to reference tool paths
- New tools that make HTTP requests MUST import and use `validateUrl()` from `tools/lib/security.mjs`
- New tools that read files MUST use `checkFileSize()` before `readFileSync()`
- GEO = Generative Engine Optimization (NOT geographic targeting)
- AEO = Answer Engine Optimization (featured snippets, voice assistants)
- Auth env vars: `ULTRASHIP_GSC_CREDENTIALS`, `ULTRASHIP_GSC_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `ULTRASHIP_BING_KEY`, `ULTRASHIP_GA4_CREDENTIALS`, `ULTRASHIP_GA4_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Auth also reads from `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` env vars (set via `userConfig` in plugin.json)
- Agent frontmatter uses `model`, `effort`, `maxTurns`, `tools`, `skills` per official Claude Code plugin spec
- Opus agents: code-reviewer, pentest-auditor, seo-strategist, incident-responder (effort: high)
- Sonnet agents: all others (effort: medium)
- Each agent has `tools` restricted to only what it needs (Bash, Read, Grep, Glob, etc.)
- Each agent has `skills` preloaded for its domain (e.g., seo-strategist preloads seo-strategy)
- Skill frontmatter uses `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`, `paths` per official spec
- Hooks use `statusMessage` for UX feedback during execution
- PostCompact hook re-injects ultraship context after conversation compaction
- UserPromptSubmit hook (`currency-guard.sh`) detects version-sensitive prompts (library/SDK APIs, versions, pricing, model IDs, "latest") and injects a directive to verify against current sources (context7/WebSearch) instead of training data. Pairs with the `staying-current` skill. Exits 0, injects only on a match, escapes JSON via sed.
- Skills/commands can set `disallowed-tools` in frontmatter to remove tools while active (e.g. code-review and investigate block Edit/Write/NotebookEdit)

## Publishing

- `npm publish` with granular token via `.npmrc`
- Git commits use `houseofmvps2024@gmail.com`
- Version bump in both `package.json` and test before publishing
